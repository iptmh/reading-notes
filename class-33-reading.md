### *Redux - Additional Topics*

## Redux Toolkit

+ It's for efficient Redux development
+ It is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic
+ This toolkit specifies a few different means of building a reducer and action set that work well together and are easier to understand and integrate
+ It includes several utility functions that simplify the most common Redux use cases, including store setup, defining reducers, immutable update logic, and even creating entire "slices" of state at once without writing any action creators or action types by hand. 
+ It also includes the most widely used Redux addons, like Redux Thunk for async logic and Reselect for writing selector functions, so that you can use them right away.

+ Redux Toolkit was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux:

"Configuring a Redux store is too complicated"
"I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful"
"Redux requires too much boilerplate code"

+ You are not required to use Redux Toolkit to use Redux, but using Redux Toolkit will make your code better and more maintainable.
