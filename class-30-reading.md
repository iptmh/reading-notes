### *Graphs*

Graphs are mathematical structures that represent pairwise relationships between objects. A graph is a flow structure that represents the relationship between various objects. It can be visualized by using the following two basic components:

Nodes: These are the most important components in any graph. Nodes are entities whose relationships are expressed using edges. If a graph comprises 2 nodes  and  and an undirected edge between them, then it expresses a bi-directional relationship between the nodes and edge.

Edges: Edges are the components that are used to represent the relationships between various nodes in a graph. An edge between two nodes expresses a one-way or two-way relationship between the nodes.

Types of nodes

Root node: The root node is the ancestor of all other nodes in a graph. It does not have any ancestor. Each graph consists of exactly one root node. Generally, you must start traversing a graph from the root node.

Leaf nodes: In a graph, leaf nodes represent the nodes that do not have any successors. These nodes only have ancestor nodes. They can have any number of incoming edges but they will not have any outgoing edges.

Types of graphs

Undirected: An undirected graph is a graph in which all the edges are bi-directional i.e. the edges do not point in any specific direction.

Directed: A directed graph is a graph in which all the edges are uni-directional i.e. the edges point in a single direction.

Weighted: In a weighted graph, each edge is assigned a weight or cost. 

Cyclic: A graph is cyclic if the graph comprises a path that starts from a vertex and ends at the same vertex. That path is called a cycle. An acyclic graph is a graph that has no cycle.
