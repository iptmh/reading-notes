#### Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser? 

Running JavaScript outside of a web browser lets us do a lot more with JavaScript aside from simple websites. We do this by using a new ecosystem, or environment, called Node.js to run our JavaScript code.

#### What is the difference between a module and a package? 

Modules are pieces of JavaScript code that are meant to be called in another file or chunk of code. Think of a function with inputs and outputs; you can define the function, but itâ€™s not run until the function is called later in the code. Packages are an extension of modules, and they are what make the Node.js ecosystem so powerful. Packages allow developers to make complex chunks of code that serve a certain purpose, and then publish and share those packages for other developers to use.

#### What is one benefit of Test Driven Development? 

This means planning out the input format and expected outputs of a module before development, and it can help prevent uncertainty during the development process.

#### What is one potential downside of Test Driven Development? 

Test-driven development does not perform sufficient testing in situations where full functional tests are required to determine success or failure, due to extensive use of unit tests. A high number of passing unit tests may bring a false sense of security, resulting in fewer additional software testing activities, such as integration testing and compliance testing.

#### What does the node package manager do? 

Node Package Manager (NPM) is two things: first, it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node. js projects; second, it is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management.
