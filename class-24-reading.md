### *Routing and Component*

#### Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?
Because React app is composed of components.And we can use the package react-router-dom to build a multi page app.

#### If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
Inside the BrowserRouter, outside a Route

#### What does props.children contain?
Section component that we want to be versatile. What this.props.children does is that it is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component.
