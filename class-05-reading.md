### *Class 05 DSA: Linked Lists*

#### What is a data structure?
In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

#### How is a Linked List different from an array?
An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type. Linked List is an ordered collection of elements of the same type in which each element is connected to the next using pointers. Array elements can be accessed randomly using the array index. Random accessing is not possible in linked lists.

#### What is one benefit a Linked List has over an array?
An array tends to be more ridgid; adding to an array or deleting from an array can be costly.

#### What data does a Node hold in a doubly Linked List?
Each Node holds a link to the next AND previous Nodes in the list, often called next and prev.

#### What would you use to implement a Linked List data type? (object, function, class, variableâ€¦?)
Function
