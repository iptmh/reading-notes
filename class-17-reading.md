### *TCP Servers*

#### What do the layers in the OSI and TCP/IP models represent?
Whenever two independent systems communicate, we have to provide a series of rules and structure so that security is ensured and both applications know what to do at each step of the process. There are many collections of rules we could follow, but a standard set is the Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model, or OSI. This is a seven-layer procedure for what protocols to use when transferring data.

#### What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?
So that they’re easy to send over the internet

#### UDP is often referrered to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?
UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is less secure; when transferring data it doesn’t establish a strong secure connection between the sending server and the receiving server. 

#### Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections? Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers? Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?
Yes for three.
